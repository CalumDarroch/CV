I am a recent graduate from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)'s intensive programming bootcamp looking to make my first strides into the dynamic and exciting world of tech! An ex-actor and screenwriter, at the start of 2019 I decided to radically change my career after realising a few things about myself:
- I wanted more intellectual challenge and opportunities to solve problems in my work.
- I love building things and working with others to design, plan and execute projects.
- I am passionate about the potential for technology to solve complex business, economic and social problems.
- While I am creative, I am also logically-minded and drawn to learning technical skills.

Software engineering was the perfect fit, and upon beginning the course I instantly found myself to be more engaged with and enthusiastic about it than anything in my diverse work history. After graduating from my masters degree in December 2011, I had previously pursued a career as a lawyer for two years before deciding I wanted to do something more creative, and going on to spend over five years pursuing writing and acting for stage and screen. In this time I worked in many different jobs - such as waitering, NHS administration and history tour guiding - in order to support myself and to pay for training. During the course the benefits of all this experience became much more clear to me, as I was often able to bring a novel perspective to engineering problems and view them in a more multi-faceted/holistic manner.

## Skills

#### Creative problem-solving

I have always enjoyed working on complex problems that require "outside the box" thinking. In the [StarGazer](https://github.com/CalumDarroch/stargazer) project our team faced many challenges that required creative solutions. Star objects were initially difficult to see in the app, and I implemented a number of solutions (such as a system of AR night-sky tiles behind the objects) to make them more visible before settling on a particle effect. This required a lot of research as I was writing in an unfamiliar language and development environment, but by applying best practices and rapid iteration, I was able to implement a very effective solution and was thrilled with the results!

In my previous work in film, there were many times when last-minute major changes would have to be made to scripts and shooting schedules for logistical reasons, and I would have to design and implement a new solution from scratch. This was always an intense challenge that required balancing practicalities with the need to be faithful to the intention of the writer. In one case I was able to cut four scenes/locations from a shoot, organize the new schedule, and put in a new scene that captured everything we wanted to show in that time.

#### Logical approach

I am dedicated to applying best principles in programming to my work and endeavour always to tackle problems systematically and logically. Furthermore, my training at Makers has given me a deep appreciation of fundamental engineering principles, particularly approaching any project/design with emphasis on the following:
```
Function -> Use -> Form
```
Understanding first how a product is to work on a granular level (input/output), followed by how the user will interact with it, is central to how I design a final program. By following the principles of TDD and constant iteration/improvement, I approach software design from the ground-up and ensure that the design fits the use-case, rather than trying to shoehorn the user's requirements into a pre-determined design!

#### Adaptability

As a software engineer, flexibility is at the core of what I do. Whether it's going from a class-based language like Ruby to learning JavaScript's prototype-based structure in a week, or working with a completely unfamiliar tech stack, I am committed to constant learning and development. I place an emphasis on being stack/language-agnostic, believing that there is no such thing as a bad tool, just a bad application for that tool. Since beginning coding in March I have written software in four languages and experimented with many different libraries, frameworks and CI/CD services. My stack choices have been based on which tool I thought was best for the job - and going out and learning more about that toolset - rather than working with a sub-optimal stack because it was what I was used to.

#### Communication and Presentation

I believe that working effectively in a team requires direct, clear communication and the ability to adapt to different members to make sure that everyone is on the same page. Working on various team projects at Makers gave me great experience of agile methodologies, including standups and retros, sprints and code reviews. By talking through problems with the team and helping each other reach possible solutions (and delegating work) I was able to help us through a few difficult problems, particularly in week 2 of the Acebook project when a number of issues occurred all at once and the team were beginning to feel a bit derailed. By setting aside the time to talk through the issues logically, form a solid plan and start working at it systematically, I was able to get us back on track.

These skills were vital to me in my previous work as an actor and a tour guide. The latter role in particular was very demanding in this department, as I was often leading large crowds of people around busy tourist hotspots in central London. The ability to not only communicate clearly to everyone, but also in a way that engaged everybody and allowed individuals to participate and have any questions answered, was something I was eager to develop.

#### Curiosity

I have always been driven by a desire for deeper understanding in everything I do, and coding is no exception. In my time at Makers I have been engaged in self-directed learning from the start, and with each project or challenge have gone beyond the necessary requirements to complete tasks in order to gain a more thorough knowledge of the underlying principles at play. For example, in our Acebook task we used the Ruby on Rails framework, which can be used to automate a lot of the structure and design decisions in creating a web app. While we followed the file architecture generated by the framework, I was compelled to work out why this structure had been recommended and the pros and cons of the design decisions that had gone into it. By the end of the project, I had learnt a lot more than if I had just followed the prescribed structure without delving deeper into the design (for example, I learnt a lot about symbols in Ruby!), and I think that this lead not only to an improvement of my understanding but also to the program itself.

## Education

### Makers Academy (March to July 2019)

Over the course I was often surprised by the speed at which my technical understanding developed, and was grateful for the opportunities for group work, collaboration and self-directed learning afforded by the work environment.

I have focused on developing the following skills:
- Understanding the principles of object-oriented programming, domain modelling and the MVC architectural pattern.
- Emphasis on best practices in process, especially TDD, pair-programming, extreme programming and agile/SCRUM methodologies.
- Familiarity with two different OOP languages: Ruby and JavaScript.
- Language agnosticism: learning the principles that underpin programming languages, so that I can pick up new languages and tech quickly.
- A familiarity with testing frameworks (such as RSpec and Jasmine).
- CI/CD practices.
- Integrating databases and APIs into apps.

I passed my final process review in mid-July and am now signed-off by the coaches and careers team as having attained the standards expected of a junior software engineer.

### The University of Manchester (2007 to 2011)

**LLM Intellectual Property Law - Distinction**

For my Masters degree I chose to study intellectual property, with a particular interest in copyright and patent law. My second dissertation, *Problems and Progress in the Protection of Video Games*, was published in the University of Manchester Law Review.

**LLB Law - 2:1**

My undergraduate degree covered a broad range of topics, but my main areas of interest were intellectual property and law and ethics in war and warfare. The latter covered many broadly applicable logical and philosophical concepts, particularly involving decision-making and game theory.
