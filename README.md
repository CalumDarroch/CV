I am a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) in London. An ex-actor and screenwriter, at the start of 2019 I decided to radically change my career, and having wanted to try my hand at computer programming signed up for Makers' April 2019 intake. I've always loved to make things, and thought coding would an opportunity for me to do that in new and interesting ways.

## Background

After graduating from my masters degree in Intellectual Property Law in December 2011, I pursued a career as a lawyer for around two years before deciding I wanted to do something more creatively challenging. Over that time I learned that I was poorly suited to the rigid working environment of a corporate law firm, and with opportunity thin on the ground I decided to make the leap into a career in the arts.

Over the course of five years I pursued writing and acting for stage and screen, taking on many different jobs in order to make ends meet and to pay for classes, workshops and training. I ended up working in roles as diverse as waitering, NHS administration and private history tour guiding in London, all while writing plays/screnplays and auditioning for acting roles. Over that time I was successful in gaining paid roles in fringe theatre, short films and some TV and commercial work, as well as securing representation from two agencies and gaining certified listings with Equity and Spotlight - something that is notoriously difficult for actors who have not attended a 3 year programme at a drama school.

Ultimately, however, in early 2019 I decided it was time for me to change direction again. The hectic and insecure working conditions of the arts were something I felt no longer served me and the direction I saw my life going in, and despite my enjoyment of the work I had been fortunate enough to be involved in thus far, I felt as though my work lacked intellectual challenge. Although initially I felt overwhelmed by the thought of starting another career from scratch and the myriad of options that were available, I soon settled on software development as a discipline that fulfilled everything I was looking for in a job: challenge, creativity, the chance to work in an innovative and rapidly changing industry, and the opportunity to master a technical skill. With that in mind, I took the leap and signed up for Makers April chohort and haven't looked back!

## Projects

Project | Description | Development Timeframe | Tech Stack | CI/CD/Testing |
:------:|:-----------:|:---------------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
[StarGazer](https://github.com/CalumDarroch/stargazer) | This was my final group engineering project for the Makers course. An augmented reality iOS app, it allows you to see the positions of major stars and planets on your phone. This was a very difficult challenge; as a small team of four we had to learn a completely new tech stack over the two weeks, using an unfamiliar IDE and working on mobile for the first time, all while using agile best practices. The app was a huge success at the careers fair and we were very happy with the results! You can see it in action [here](https://youtu.be/2mJJrip4emc). | 2 weeks | Swift, XCode (ARKit, SceneKit, UIKit) | Quick, Nimble, Carthage, Codacy, XCode CI
[Acebook](https://github.com/CalumDarroch/acebook-FiveGuys) | A Facebook clone completed during the course, as a team of five we worked to build a simple social networking site under the direction of the course coaches. We used this as an opportunity to experiment with different ways of working, such as sprinting, mobbing, pairing and various aspects of agile development and extreme programming. This was also our first experience using a web-application framework - here Ruby on Rails - and working with CI/CD. Our site is hosted on Heroku [here](https://secret-forest-11009.herokuapp.com/). | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, jQuery, HTML/CSS | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, Heroku, Codacy
[MakersBnB](https://github.com/CalumDarroch/MakersBnB) | A short group challenge to build a clone of AirBnB, our small team of four decided to attempt it in JavaScript having only begun learning it the previous week! | 1 week | JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS | Jasmine, Nightwatch, Cypress
Reversi Terminal Game | An ongoing personal project, with the object of learning Python and its testing frameworks, as well as more complex back-end logic | Ongoing | Python | Unittest

## Skills

#### Creative problem-solving

As a writer I have noticed many parallels between creative writing and coding. I always approach any kind of writing as a problem to be solved, and have spent a lot of time working at my ability to brainstorm new and creative solutions to problems presented in my work.

#### Communication and Presentation

In my recent work as an actor and a tour guide, these skills were (as you might imagine!) essential. The latter role in particular was very demanding in this department, as I was often leading large crowds of people around busy tourist hotspots in central London. The ability to not only communicate clearly to everyone, but also in a way that engaged everybody and allowed individuals to participate and have any questions answered, was something I was eager to develop. 

## Education

### Makers Academy (March to July 2019)

I undertook the Makers Academy course beginning April 2019, having spent a month previously on the pre-course materials and having a lot of fun doing so! Over the course I was often surprised by the speed at which my technical understanding developed, and was grateful for the opportunities for group work, collaboration and self-directed learning afforded by the work environment.

Over my time on the course I have focused on developing the following skills:
- Understanding the principles of object-oriented programming, domain modelling and the MVC architectural pattern.
- Emphasis on best practices in process, especially TDD, pair-programming, extreme programming and agile/SCRUM methodologies.
- Familiarity with two different OOP languages: Ruby and JavaScript.
- Language agnosticism: learning the principles that underpin programming languages, so that I can pick up new languages and tech quickly.
- A familiarity with testing framworks (such as RSpec and Jasmine).
- CI/CD practices.
- Integrating databases and APIs into apps.

I passed my final process review in mid-July and am now signed-off by the coaches and careers team as having attained the standards expected of a junior software engineer.

### The University of Manchester (2007 to 2011)

**LLM Intellectual Property Law - Distinction**

For my Masters degree I chose to study intellectual property, with a particular interest in copyright and patent law. My second dissertation, *Problems and Progress in the Protection of Video Games*, was published in the University of Manchester Law Review.

**LLB Law - 2:1**

My undergraduate degree covered a broad range of topics, but my main areas of interest were intellectual property and law and ethics in war and warfare. The latter covered many broadly applicable logical and philosophical concepts, particularly involving decision-making and game theory.
