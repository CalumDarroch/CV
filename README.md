I am an ex-actor and screenwriter who in late 2018 decided to radically change my career. In 2019 I signed up to [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to try my hand at computer programming - I've always loved to make things, and thought coding would be a great way to scratch that itch. Now having graduated from Makers at the end of June, I hope to secure a job as a junior developer.

## Skills

#### Creative problem-solving

As a writer I have noticed many parallels between creative writing and coding. I always approach any kind of writing as a problem to be solved, and have spent a lot of time working at my ability to brainstorm new and creative solutions to problems presented in my work.

#### Communication and Presentation

In my recent work as an actor and a tour guide, these skills were (as you might imagine!) essential. The latter role in particular was very demanding in this department, as I was often leading large crowds of people around busy tourist hotspots in central London. The ability to not only communicate clearly to everyone, but also in a way that engaged everybody and allowed individuals to participate and have any questions answered, was something I was eager to develop. 

## Education

### Makers Academy (March to June 2019)

I am undertaking the Makers Academy course beginning April 2019, having spent the last month on the pre-course materials and having a lot of fun doing so! During the precourse I have been pleasantly surprised by the speed at which my understanding has developed, and have also had opportunities to try my hand at pair-programming with a few of my fellow students (both in-person and remotely).

Skills I hope to develop while on the full-time course on site:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

### The University of Manchester (2007 to 2011)

**LLM Intellectual Property Law - Distinction**

For my Masters degree I chose to study intellectual property, with a particular interest in copyright and patent law. My second dissertation, *Problems and Progress in the Protection of Video Games*, was published in the University of Manchester Law Review.

**LLB Law - 2:1**

My undergraduate degree covered a broad range of topics, but my main areas of interest were intellectual property and law and ethics in war and warfare. The latter covered many broadly applicable logical and philosophical concepts, particularly involving decision-making and game theory.

### Other Qualifications

**The Impulse Company**  
I have a qualification in the Meisner technique from Impulse, an actor's company run by Scott Williams in London. The training lasted a full year and I graduated in December 2016.
